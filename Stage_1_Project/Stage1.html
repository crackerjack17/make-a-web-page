			<div class="concept-descriptions-lesson-1">
          <p>
      		HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em> also referred to as Hypertext Transfer Protocol. HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web. HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes "what you see" and <em>markup</em> which describes "how it looks".

				Tags and Elements
			</div>
			<div class="concept-descriptions-lesson-1">
          <p>
      		HTML is made up of elements that contain tags.  The tags define the element such as boldness, italized, lists, hyperlinks to name a few.

			<div class="concept-descriptions-lesson-1">
          <p>
      		Computers only function because a person has written, or coded, a       program to make them work.  When you make a mistake in your code, the computer will let you know it!

				Inline vs. Block Elements
			</div>
		<div class="concept-descriptions-lesson-1">
          <p>
      		HTML elements are either <b>Inline</b> or <b>Block</b>. Block level elements normally start (and end) with a new line, when displayed in a browser.  Inline elements are normally displayed without line breaks.

      		HTML is the language used to code, CSS gives the coding style.  CSS works on a system of rules, which select the elements you want to style, and then set values for different properties of the elements. You can change or add colors, backgrounds, font sizes and styles, and even position things on your web page in different places. Javascript allows you to add behaviour to your code, such as an animated element, validation of form data that's input and much more.

				Structure of HTML
			</div>
		<div class="concept-descriptions-lesson-1">
          <p>
      		 Developers use a "tree-like structure" that "nests" the element tags.  This makes it easier to see where tags start and stop within a body of content.  This proves especially helpful when editting contents.

				HTML and boxes
			</div>
		<div class="concept-descriptions-lesson-1">
          <p>
      		 As noted above in the structure of HTML, you will see that coding and content is structured in "boxes".  In a sense, your content is comparmentalized.  This is helpful for organization and readability of your code.

				Text Editors
			</div>
		<div class="concept-descriptions-lesson-1">
          <p>
      		Text editors such as Stratchpaid.io, Codepen, etc. have some built in and automated editting features allowing the user to more easily create and have code validated.  It's like an extra set of eyes on your code to make sure it displays as desired.

	    		Box Sizing and Positioning
	    	</div>
	    	<div class="concept-descriptions-lesson-1">
          <p>
      		HTML elements are boxes and each box has 4 components: Margin; Padding; Border and the Box itself.  There are two ways to size these componets, by pixel or percentage.

          <p>
      		CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.  You can use mulitple sheets in your coding.  Cascading is the idea knows as <b>inheritance</b> and understanding requires abstract thinking. Some properties that can be inherited are color, font, and certain spacing.
